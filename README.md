1) likely need to remove or replace <mimic> joints
2) NVIDIA Hahah, on your own there bud
3) Use a clean EE link like ee_link or gripper_center_link (not a finger tip). Point Manipulator config to that link prim, not a joint..
4)Drive one finger joint, couple the other. In Manipulator config, list the main joint and its mimic.

Good Luck!
